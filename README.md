The weirdest tracker written in 1995 with Turbo Pascal, running in a dosbox. It uses the 9 channels of the opl2 FM synthesizer in the Soundblaster Pro sound card. Press F2 to make it quiet.

### Building (without compiling Pascal)
  - Run `npm start`

### Compiling
  - Ensure you have Turbo Pascal 7 installed in directory `./tp`. This will be seen as `C:\TP\` for dosbox.
  - Ensure you have homebrew and node installed
  - Run `npm run compile`
  - Run `npm start`
